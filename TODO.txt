It would be nice if `opCmp` could return custom type, not int. This
was possible in D1.0 afaik, not in D2 anymore.

  // auto l = a < b;
  //   Error: incompatible types for (a.opCmp(b)) < (0): Condition and int

Also, similar it would be nice to be able to overload `&&` and `||`.

  // auto two = amb.Lt(0) && apb.Lt(amb);
  //   Error: expression amb.result_.Lt(0) of type Condition does not have a boolean value
  //   Error: expression apb.result_.Lt(amb.result_) of type Condition does not have a boolean value
